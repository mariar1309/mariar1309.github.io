Instructions for graders on how to reproduce results. 

My code for this project is split across 3 files: fun_filters.ipynb, align_image_code.py, and hybrid_image_starter.py
The bulk of the code (all tasks exceot Part 2.2) is located in fun_filters.ipynb. Load the notebook and run all cells in order to 
reproduce my results. 

Part 2.2 uses the starter files provided (align_image_code.py + hybrid_image_starter.py) with my added changes. To reproduce those results, 
load and run hybrid_image_starter.py as is.
