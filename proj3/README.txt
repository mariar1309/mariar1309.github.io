All of the code for this project (3A only) is contained in part_a.py. 
Every part can be executed by uncommenting the corresponding section in __main___, I left comments that 
differentiate each one from each other. 

For Part B, I did all of the work in part_b.py. Simply running python3 part_b.py should execute everything in 
__main__ in order.
